# Data Analytics Assignments - Bachelor of Informatics Honours

## Overview

Completing this module deepened my understanding of **data analysis techniques** for statistical tasks. I gained knowledge in **design and ethical considerations**, along with hands-on experience in **data cleaning, manipulation, exploratory analysis, modeling, and visualization** using **R**. The assignments in this module provided practical applications of these skills in real-world scenarios.
This repository contains assignments completed as part of my **Postgraduate Honours in Informatics**, focusing on **data analytics** in the module **Information & Knowledge in Organisations**. These assignments involved data wrangling, visualization, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze real-world datasets and uncover meaningful insights.
